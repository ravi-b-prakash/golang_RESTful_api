This project is a simple RESTful API web service using Go and Gin. I am storing people's names and their IDs in my local storage and there are three endpoints :
1) /items (GET) : For getting the names and IDs of all people.
2) /items (POST) : For adding a new name and ID.
3) /items/:id (GET) : For getting one name who has the corresponding ID.
